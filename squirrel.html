<p>
  Once I found a baby squirrel which had fallen out the tree in my back garden,
  it had a injured leg which I fixed with a robot squirrel leg (I made a long
  time ago for this occasion) but before I fixed it I called the little
  squirrel, Andy, so I changed it to Android S and so I also made a little
  corner in my treehouse for Android. Had lots to play with and a nice snuggly
  home.
