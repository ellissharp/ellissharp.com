# Zelda Breath of the Wild

I love playing Zelda because it is a RPG (Role-Playing Game) where you can just have fun by fighting monsters, completing shrines, towers and quests. There are 120 fun shrines to complete and work through. 

When you conquer your first Divine Beast or complete a quest you feel pride and joy in moving foward in the game. As you go through and do the Divine Beasts they give you powers and abilities like Mipha's Grace and Revali's Gale.

There are older versions such as Link to the Past, Link's Awakening and Wind Waker. These are for older consoles like NES or GameBoy, but you can still enjoy the fun in Zelda. 

In Breath of the Wild, the game graphics are absolutedly amazing with rays of the sun beaming down on you, and the water is so realistic.

## My Advice

If you are thinking about getting Zelda Breath of the Wild then I advise you to go down the outside the Shrine of Ressurrection and go talk to the old man.

Once you have done that get the woodcutters axe, which is at the bottom of the hill then follow the instructions that the old man gives you. Then you will have to defeat some monsters and have fun! You need to be wary of the monsters when you turn corners like in a shrine you will be surprised attacked by guardian scouts.

You will be able to get the champions tunic after recalling a memory then going to Impa (who is the chief of Kakariko Village) and she will give you the
champions tunic, which gives you the power to see the monster's health above thier head even through walls which will help a lot further on in the game.
