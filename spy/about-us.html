  We work secretly overseas to gather intelligence from people and
  organisations. Our work is often referred to as &#39;espionage&#39; or
  &#39;spying&#39;. It has to be done in secret to protect our staff, our
  agents, our technology and ultimately the UK. &#39;Agents&#39; are individuals
  who choose to help us collect intelligence.

  The risks to UK security, as identified in the National Security Strategy, are
  becoming increasingly diverse. Past threats were more predictable, but today’s
  adversaries are constantly changing. So the ability to adapt and combine the
  UK’s collective security resources is paramount. M.I.A plays a prominent role
  in supporting UK national security against three of the four highest priority
  risks – by countering international terrorism, combating weapons
  proliferation, supporting stability overseas and securing the UK&#39;s cyber
  advantage. As laid out in the Strategic Defence and Security Review, we focus
  on identifying risks and opportunities at the earliest possible stage, shaping
  developments and preventing threats from emerging.
