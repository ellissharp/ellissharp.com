<h2 id="about-us">ABOUT US</h2>
<p>We work secretly overseas to gather intelligence from people and organisations. Our work is often referred to as &#39;espionage&#39; or &#39;spying&#39;. It has to be done in secret to protect our staff, our agents, our technology and ultimately the UK. &#39;Agents&#39; are individuals who choose to help us collect intelligence.</p>
