  We are M.I.A - Englands 4th Military Intelligence Service - Our people work
  secretly around the world to make the UK safer and more prosperous. Even
  though we just been made we’ve been on extra lookout. We are creative and
  determined - using cutting-edge technology and espionage. We have three core
  aims: stopping terrorism, disrupting the activity of hostile states, and
  giving the UK a cyber advantage. Many M.I.A staff are based overseas while
  others work from our headquarters. Although our work is secret, everything we
  do is legal and is underpinned by the values that define the UK.
