  How to care for a squirrel
</h1>

<p>
  If you find a wild squirrel injured outside and it is legal for you to help
  the squirrel, then make sure to provide him with a proper shelter. Wild
  squirrels do not carry rabies as a rule, but it is possible for any
  warm-blooded animal to be infected so be careful. If you are bitten, clean the
  wound out with some water and call your doctor for further treatment. Having
  the squirrel tested for diseases will result in the squirrel&#39;s death.
  However, if you don&#39;t have a cage there are other options.Injured
  squirrels found in the wild tend to be babies. They often fall from nests or
  get lost from their mothers. A baby squirrel can be comfortable housed in a
  small box, such as a shoe box. You should leave the shoebox outside, away from
  other predators, and keep it open. This way, if he&#39;s lost his mother will
  be able to find him and retrieve him. However, you can keep the shoebox in
  your garage or a closed off room in your home if leaving the squirrel outdoors
  is not an option.If you intend the keep the squirrel long-term because a
  rehabber or wildlife rescue is not an option, you&#39;re going to need a lot
  of time and money. The first step is to get a cage. Adult squirrels need tall
  cages so they can move around and play. Baby squirrels need smaller cages so
  they don&#39;t climb and end up falling and hurting themselves. If you have an
  old cat cage or pet carrier, you could use this for a baby squirrel. If
  it&#39;s plastic, the squirrel will chew through it quickly. An old bird cage,
  at least 3 feet tall, might work very temporarily for an adult squirrel. You
  can also purchase animal cages of a variety of shapes and sizes at your local
  pet store. Critter/Ferret nations are recommended for the small bar spacings
  and size. After finding a suitable container for the squirrel, you&#39;ll need
  to give him nest and bedding material. This helps him stay warm and
  comfortable and also mimics some of the conditions of his natural habitat.
  Squirrels enjoy building a nest for sleeping. Do not use cardboard as it dries
  out the skin and mucous membranes. Many pet stores sell nest boxes for birds
  for relatively low prices. These could work to keep your squirrel feeling warm
  and safe. Squirrels need to have a lot of bedding and padding to keep warm.
  However, be careful of what kind of materials you&#39;re using. Use old
  clothing, like old cotton or fleece shirts. However, stay away from towels orother items made of terrycloth or something similar. Squirrels can easily gettheir claws stuck in such materials, leading to injury.  If you found an injured baby squirrel, he needs to stay warm in order to survive. Wrap a hot water bottle or a heating pad in flannel or a similar material. Place it in the box or cage where you're keeping the baby squirrel. Do not cover the squirrel in any fabrics and do not put water in without wrapping it up first. This could cause the squirrel to overheat. If you use a heating pad, ensure it is non-auto-shut-off and place it half UNDER the box. After your squirrel has settled in, it's nice to give him some toys and other supplies for his entertainment. The transition from the wild to someone's home will be jarring. You want to make sure your squirrel is entertained. Small stuffed toys for children can be great toys for squirrels. Just make sure to remove any plastic parts, like plastic eyes or noses, before letting the squirrel play with it. Only give a squirrel stuffed toys that use natural stuffing. Squirrels can choke on beans or bead-like materials sometimes used to stuff toys. Hanging toys, like mobiles or cat toys with feathers on the end, can also be fun for squirrels. If you're keeping your squirrel until release, consider installing some kind of perch in his cage if he's older. Squirrels like to be able to climb. You can buy bird perches at a local pet store and install them in your squirrel's cage.
