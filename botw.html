    <p><strong>Zelda Breath of the Wild</strong></p>
    <p>
      I love playing Zelda because it is a RPG (Role-Playing Game) where you can
      just have fun by fighting monsters and completing shrines and towers. When
      you conquer a Divine Beast or complete a quest you feel pride and joy in
      moving foward in the game.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are older versians such as Link to the Past, Link&#39;s Awakening
      and Wind Waker. These are for other consoles like NES or GameBoys, but you
      can still enjoy the fun in Zelda. In Breatth of the Wild, the game
      graphics are absolutedly amazing with rays of the sun beaming down on you,
      and the water is so realistic.
    </p>
    <p><strong>My Advice</strong></p>
    <p>
      If you are thinking about getting Zelda Breath of the Wild then I advise
      you to go down the outside the Shrine of Ressurrection and go talk to the
      old man. Once you have done that get the woodcutters axe, which is at the
      bottom of the hill then follow the instructions that the old man gives
      you. Then you will have to defeat some monsters and have fun!
    </p>
    <p>
      You need to be wary of the monsters when you turn corners like in a shrine
      you will be surprised attacked by guardian scouts. You will be able to get
      the champions tunic after recalling a memory then going to Impa (who is
      the chief of Kakariko Village) and she will give you the champions tunic,
      which gives you the power to see the monster&#39;s health above thier head
      even through walls which will help a lot further on in the game.
